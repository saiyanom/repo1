                                    (“Personal Information”). Personal Information includes but is not limited to your
                                    name, email address, registered office address, or phone number.</li>
                                <li>Payment Information: If you use the Service to make or receive payments, we will
                                    also collect certain payment information, such as credit card details, bank account

                                <li>Identity Verification: We may collect Personal Information, such as your name,
                                    country, contact number and email address. Whenever a new User registers, we send
                                    them a verification email to confirm/ validate their authenticity.</li>
                                <li>General Audience Service: The Service is general audience and intended for users

                                    younger than age 18. If we become aware that a child younger than 18 has provided us
                                    with Personal Information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete
                                    such information from our files.</li>

                                    project-related data (“Non-Identifying Information”). We may also use hashed

                                    code that does not identify you directly.</li>
                                <li>Combination of Personal and Non-Identifying Information: Certain Non-Identifying
                                    Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were
                                    combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified (for
                                    example, combining information with your name). However, the same pieces of
                                    information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or
                                    combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing
                                    preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying
                                    Information, but MRKT365 will treat the combined information as Personal
                                    Information.</li>
