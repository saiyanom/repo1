                                            Parties involved in the Dispute may agree, by amicable negotiation and
                                            conciliation will first be submitted for settlement by informal

                                            request in writing (“Dispute Notice”) of the disputing Party to binding
                                            arbitration by a panel of arbitrators (“Arbitration Board”) in
                                            accordance with the Arbitration Act, 1991 in case of domestic

                                            international arbitration. All arbitration proceedings will be conducted

                                            Canada. The arbitrators will decide any such Dispute strictly in
                                            accordance with the governing law specified in Clause 14. The costs and

                                            the Arbitration Board, will be borne equally by each Party and each
                                            Party will pay its own fees, disbursements and other charges of its
                                            counsel, except as may be determined by the Arbitration Board. Any award
                                            made by the Arbitration Board will be final and binding on each of the
                                            Parties that were parties to the Dispute.</p>
