                text="As a part of our mission, we are making online marketing accessible to all businesses in developing and developed countries. In many countries, the credit card decline rate is between 25-75% according to Google. These credit card fraud rates have prevented millions of legitimate businesses and freelancers from growing their businesses online. To assist legitimate businesses, MRKT365 has partnered with Visa and Amex to provide prepaid virtual cards. We are opening the market to many new advertisers and agencies that currently canâ€™t advertise due to the restrictive billing policies of their countries."
